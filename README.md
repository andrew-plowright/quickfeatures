# âš¡ Quick Features - QGIS Plugin

This QGIS plugin speeds up workflows that involve high volumes
of manual feature creation.

Quick Feature Create implements _feature templates_ which define attribute 
values for a given vector layer. The user can activate feature templates using
keyboard shortcuts. An active feature template will auto-fill attribute values
when a feature is created, thus saving clicks and keystrokes and speeding up
 digitization.
