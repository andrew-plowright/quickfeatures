âš¡ Quick Features - QGIS Plugin
======================================================================================================
![license](https://img.shields.io/badge/Licence-GPL--3-blue.svg) 

A QGIS plugin for speeding up manual feature creation and digitization. By enabling one-click feature creation and 
linking feature templates to keyboard shorcuts, the number of clicks and keystrokes required when creating and 
switching between feature types is reduced.

This plugin was originally created to facilitate the labelling of training data from imagery, although it can
be applied to other use cases as well.

# Installation

Follow [this guide](doc/installation.md) for instructions on installing the plugin.

# How to use this plugin

## Feature templates

The plugin implements _feature templates_, which define attribute values for a given vector layer. The user can 
switch between feature templates using keyboard shortcuts. An active feature template will suppress the 'Add Feature Form'
and auto-fill attribute values when a feature is created.

## Create a feature template

To create a feature template, hit the ![Plus](quickfeatures/resources/icons/mActionAdd.svg) button. Give the new template
a name, shortcut, and select a map layer.

**NOTE: Keyboard shortcuts must be typed out. For example, if you wanted a combination of keystrokes like
'Ctrl+D' or 'Shift+D', you must type that out instead of just hitting the keys.**

## Set the feature template's attribute values

Once a map layer has been selected, hit the ![Values](quickfeatures/resources/icons/mActionEditTable.svg) button. Here, 
you can enter the attribute values for this template. Any new feature created using the template will have its attributes 
auto-filled according to these values.

Begin by clicking the checkboxes for the fields for which values should be set. Unselected fields will be ignored. 
Then enter the desired values. 

**NOTE: these values are stored as [expressions](https://docs.qgis.org/3.28/en/docs/user_manual/expressions/expression.html),
and should be formatted accordingly.** For instance:

- Integer and float values can be entered as-is: `6`, `2.123`
- String values should be single-quoted: `'John Smith'`
- Dates should be single-quoted and follow the YYYY-MM-DD format: `'2023-06-18'`
- Boolean values don't need to be quoted: `true` or `false`

### Activate the feature template

The template can be activated either by clicking its checkbox or by hitting its keyboard shortcut.

### Reuse feature templates

Feature templates will automatically be saved to QGS Project files for reuse. You can also save and reload feature 
templates as JSON files by using the ![Save](quickfeatures/resources/icons/mActionFileSave.svg) and 
![Load](quickfeatures/resources/icons/mActionFileOpen.svg) buttons.
